                <h2>Sorting of waste</h2>
                <p>
                    From October 23, you are required to sort your waste according to the new sorting regulations. Five waste bins with pictograms on them will be placed in the shared kitchen. Similarly, there will be pictograms on the buried waste containers in the parking areas, showing what should be placed in each container. Hazardous waste must still be deposited in the shed at the bulky waste facility or at the caretaker's office. 

                    You can find detailed information on how to sort your waste at https://www.kredslob.dk/produkter-og-services/genbrug-og-affald/waste-and-recycling-in-aarhus

                <h2>Bike and scooter</h2>
                <p>
                    It’s time for a bike and scooter raid.
                    By the 15/9 2023 all bikes and unregistered scooters will be marked with a yellow tag (as below). You must remove the tag from your bike/scooter on the 25/9 2023 at the latest. The tag can be reused, so please return it in the caretaker’s mailbox. If the tag is still on your bike/scooter at the mentioned date, the bike/scooter will be collected by the caretaker. Collected bikes and scooters will be stored for a period of 1 month, after which they will be discarded. If your bike/scooter by mistake is collected, you can get it back by contacting the caretaker.
                    
                    Questions can be addressed to the caretaker.

                <h2>Adjustment of the windows</h2>
                <p>
                    It is time to go through all the windows at the dormitory. In that connection, we need to have access to your rental. It is important that you remove everything in front of the window and the window sills, so the caretaker has room to do the job.
                    The work is carried out from November 20 to December 15 
                    between 9.00 am – 13.00 pm - beginning with
                    Risdalsvej 34 + 38, 36 + 40, 42 + 46, 44 + 48, etc.
                    
                    On a notice in the hallway, the caretaker will inform you, 1-2 days before
                    access to your room/apartment is needed. If nobody is home, the caretaker will gain access to your rental with a masterkey. If you do not want us to enter your room without your presence, please notify the caretaker, to make another access agreement. After the visit, the caretaker will leave a note confirming that he was in your room.
                    
                    Any questions can be directed to me on telephone 21 24 75 52.
